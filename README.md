# Client and server

Bun API in `server/`, Svelte 5 + SvelteKit + Vite in `app-web/`, and shared TypeScript contracts in `shared/`. Each app owns its entry points and generated environment reader; shared code should stay independent of app configuration.

```sh
bun install
env-manager gen --local
bun run start                  # web client and API, with watch/reload
bun run start:client
bun run start:server
bun test                       # unit tests
bun run check                  # typecheck root and app-web
bun run test:e2e               # Playwright desktop and iPhone suites (bunx playwright install --with-deps chromium webkit once)
```

The client proxies `/api/*` to the API and removes the `/api` prefix. For example, `/api/status` reaches the server's `/status`. The local web hostname and ports are configured during scaffolding; inspect the root `.env` for defaults.

## Environment

`env-manager` manages one root `.env` schema with directory targets. The root `.env.local` is the only place to edit local values. Run `env-manager gen --local` after editing either file; it generates `app-web/.env.local`, `server/.env.local`, `server/src/env.ts`, and `app-web/env.ts` (SvelteKit reserves `src/env.ts`). Commands from child directories find the owning root. There are no independent child schemas.

The scaffold runs `env-manager init --local` and `env-manager gen --local`. Persistent `local:true` keeps setup offline and avoids automatic Git commits. See `env-manager --help` for schema types, target selection, and opting into remote storage with `--no-local`.

Keep `.env` and generated TypeScript readers tracked. Ignore all `.env.local` files and generated Swift values. Read server configuration through `server/src/env.ts`; the client's reader is for Vite's Node-side configuration, not browser code. Browser requests use `/api` and must never import server secrets or the environment reader.

## iOS app

`app-ios/` contains the SwiftUI app, Xcode project, Swift package, and executable `scripts/run` launcher. It uses the same Swift template as the standalone scaffold.

```sh
bun run start:ios --targets
bun run start:ios -t simulator
bun run start:ios -t mac --no-watch
```

`app-web/` contains the web client. `start:client` runs it; `start` runs the web client and API; launch iOS separately with `start:ios`. Arguments pass through to `app-ios/scripts/run`. See `app-ios/README.md` and `app-ios/AGENTS.md` for native development and signing.

The root `.env` declares `app-web format=ts path=.env.local generate=env.ts`, `server format=ts path=.env.local generate=src/env.ts`, and `app-ios format=swift path=Config/LocalSecrets.xcconfig`. Paths are relative to each target directory. `env-manager gen --local` projects its selected values into `app-ios/Config/LocalSecrets.xcconfig`. `API_URL` is shared by Vite's proxy and the native app; read it in Swift with `AppEnvironment.apiURL`. Configure a reachable API host in the root `.env.local` for physical devices: `127.0.0.1` points at the device itself. Regenerate and rebuild after changing values. Client and native configuration ships to users, so keep credentials scoped to the server.
