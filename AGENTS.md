# Highlights

Procrastimate is Stefan's personal task manager, a rough Todoist clone that will grow. It has one user and runs on web and iOS, with Apple Watch later. It is local first and synced, extremely snappy, and has subtle, satisfying animations. Features change often, so never keep backwards compatibility.

- Keep these goals in mind for every change.
- Before you build a feature, read `docs/PROJECT.md` and the feature files it links.
- When you add or change a feature or interaction, update `docs/PROJECT.md` and the matching feature file in the same change.

# Stack

- Tooling: Bun + TypeScript
- Server: Bun.serve API
- Client: React + Vite + TanStack Router
- UI: Tailwind CSS (enabled in **WEB_DIRECTORY**/src/index.css)
- Linting and Hooks: Oxlint + Lefthook

# Structure and commands

- `app-web/` owns React, routes, styles, and Vite. `server/` owns the Bun API. `shared/` holds environment-independent types and contracts. Read each folder's `AGENTS.md` before changing it.
- `bun run start` runs client and server; `start:client` and `start:server` run them separately. Browser API calls use the client-relative `/api` proxy.
- A `monorepo-swift` scaffold also has `app-ios/` with native instructions and its own launcher. See that folder's docs.

# Environment

- Use env-manager's root `.env` schema and named directory targets. Edit values only in the root `.env.local`, then run `env-manager gen --local`. Child values and readers are generated projections, not independent configs.
- `local:true` keeps generation offline and disables automatic Git updates. Use `env-manager --help` for target selection, schema types, and remote storage.
- Read application settings through generated `src/env.ts` in each TypeScript target. The client's reader runs only in Vite's Node context; browser code must not import it.
- Keep schema and readers tracked, values files ignored, and secrets scoped to the server target. Native and browser settings are public.
# Native app

- SwiftUI lives in `app-ios/`; read its `AGENTS.md` for native development. The root `start:ios` script delegates to `app-ios/scripts/run` and forwards launcher arguments.
- The web client lives in `app-web/`. Root `start` runs it and the server together. `start:client` and `start:server` run each individually; iOS runs separately.
- The root env-manager schema declares each directory target with explicit output paths: TypeScript values at `.env.local` and readers at `src/env.ts`, native values at `Config/LocalSecrets.xcconfig`. Regenerate the nested xcconfig with `env-manager gen --local`; never hand-edit `app-ios/Config/LocalSecrets.xcconfig`.
- `Config/Base.xcconfig` and `Config/Info.plist` bridge selected settings into `AppEnvironment.apiURL`. Native settings are bundled; server credentials belong exclusively to the server target.

- Local web host: procrastimate.localhost -> 6120; browser API calls use the /api proxy.
